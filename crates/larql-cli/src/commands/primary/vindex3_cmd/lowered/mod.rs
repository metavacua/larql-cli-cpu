//! G6d: execute a `ComponentOpPlan` through the Metal lowering.
//!
//! Everything before this rung compared the lowering against a reference
//! transcribed from the plan, which establishes **plan → lowering**
//! fidelity and nothing more. It cannot catch the plan and the lowering
//! sharing a mistake — which is exactly what the omitted four-norm
//! semantics were, and they survived every internally-consistent gate.
//!
//! So this path runs the *real container* and its logits are comparable
//! against the independent Glimmer oracle.
//!
//! Lives in the CLI because that is where the device is injected:
//! `larql-vindex` never links Metal, and `larql-compute-metal` never sees
//! a plan. This module is the only place both are in scope, which keeps
//! the lowering primitives free of plan types and the plan free of device
//! types.
