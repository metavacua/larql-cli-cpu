//! The GPTQ sequential column-elimination core.
//!
//! `ENCODER-R4.md`, "Hessian strategy": the canonical update reads a full
//! row of the *upper*-triangular Cholesky factor of `H⁻¹` per column to
//! propagate that column's quantisation error onto every remaining
//! column at once — `Cholesky(H) → H⁻¹ → Cholesky(H⁻¹)`, not merely
//! triangular solves against the first factor.
//!
//! [`larql_compute::cholesky`] returns the *lower* factor `L` (its own
//! convention throughout this workspace), so what this module needs from
//! `Cholesky(H⁻¹)` is `L_of_hinv`, and it reads it as its transpose: row
//! `q` of the upper factor `U = L_of_hinvᵀ`, from column `q` onward,
//! equals column `q` of `L_of_hinv`, from row `q` onward —
//! `U[q, k] = L_of_hinv[k, q]` for `k >= q`. That is the quantity
//! [`EliminationPlan::eliminate_row`] actually reads.
//!
//! This uses the existing hand-rolled `larql_compute::cpu::ops::linalg`
//! Cholesky, not an accelerated LAPACK backend. `ENCODER-R4.md`'s R4.2
//! rejected that backend for the real `d = 8192` site (6+ minutes,
//! incomplete) — but every site this module currently runs against is a
//! small synthetic fixture, where the scalar path is fast, already
//! proven (MEMIT depends on it), and introduces no new dependency. R4.2's
//! LAPACK acceleration is owed when this is wired against a real,
//! full-width calibration Hessian, not before.
