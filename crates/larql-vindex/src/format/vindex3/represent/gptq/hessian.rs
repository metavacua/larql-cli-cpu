//! The dead/alive column partition GPTQ derives from a raw calibration
//! Hessian, and the reduced sub-matrix it actually factorises.
//!
//! `ENCODER-R4.md`, "Dead coordinates — an exact rule, not a threshold":
//! a column `j` with raw `H[j,j] == 0` (checked before damping, no
//! epsilon) carried zero energy across the whole calibration pass — its
//! entire row and column in the raw Hessian are exactly zero, because
//! `H[j,j] = sum_x x_j(x)^2` is a sum of non-negative terms, so `== 0`
//! forces `x_j(x) == 0` for every calibration sample, which in turn
//! forces `H[j,m] = sum_x x_j(x) x_m(x) == 0` for every other coordinate
//! `m` — not approximately, exactly, in floating point (every term in
//! that sum is `0.0 * finite`, which IEEE-754 computes as exactly `0.0`).
//!
//! Two ways to honour "no error propagated from or into j" follow from
//! that: rely on the resulting block-diagonal structure to decouple `j`
//! automatically inside a full dense solve, or exclude `j` from the
//! linear algebra outright. This module takes the second, more literal
//! reading — `j` never enters the reduced Hessian GPTQ factorises, so
//! "no error propagated from or into j" is a structural guarantee of the
//! gather, not a numerical property a reader has to trust.
