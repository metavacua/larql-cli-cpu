/// block spans the end of row 0 and the start of row 1 under a single
/// shared scale. Nothing crashes. The bytes serialise, the segment table
/// is self-consistent, the container loads, and the arm produces
/// plausible behavioural numbers from semantically invalid bytes.
///
/// **This matters most once REPRESENT searches automatically.** The
/// optimiser enumerates candidate scopes; under the wrong rule it can
/// discover scopes that look valid, measure them, and fold the results
/// into a Pareto curve that is quietly part fiction. A representation
/// error that fails loudly costs an afternoon; this one would cost the
/// curve's credibility. `KQuant::plan` is where the rule lives, and

/// asserts both halves so it cannot be "simplified" back to the total.
///
/// NVFP4 is a split pack — codes, then group scales, then a tensor scale
/// — whose planner derives a layout from a 2-D shape. A K-quant is
/// contiguous ggml blocks running along the row. The two share this
/// function's plan-then-write skeleton and nothing else, which is why
/// this is a target rather than a flag on one path.
