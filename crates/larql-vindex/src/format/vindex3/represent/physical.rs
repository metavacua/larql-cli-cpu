//! **Physical regions, and composing a model from several of them.**
//!
//! Execution holds a REFERENCE to a physical region; it never owns the
//! bytes. The region owns the backing and its lifetime.
//!
//! ```text
//! PhysicalStore (mmap'd segment | owned bytes)
//!        │
//!        └── WeightRegion { backing, offset, len }
//!                  │
//!                  └── execution binds this
//! ```
//!
//! Two things follow, and the second is why this is a seam rather than a
//! convenience.
//!
//! **A model can be composed from several representation layers without
//! touching the semantic graph.** A sparse candidate overlay supplies
//! the operands its precision map compiled; everything else falls back
//! to the source container. The graph does not know or care:
//!
//! ```text
//! layer 1 expert weights  -> candidate overlay (Q6_K)
//! everything else         -> source container  (BF16)
//! ```
//!
//! That is exactly the shape K3 needs — a cold source plus a hot compact
//! representation plus a resident cache — arrived at here because a
//! quality experiment needed it first.
//!
//! **A region carries the identity of the store it came from.** This
//! codebase has repeatedly been bitten by verifying VALUES and not
//! objects: an aliased buffer decodes to plausible numbers while being
//! the wrong physical thing. So a caller can assert that the operand it
//! believes is executing from the candidate really is, rather than
//! inferring it from the numbers coming out.
