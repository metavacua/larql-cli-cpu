//! Which exact computation produced a carrier (RESIDUAL-BUS-2, I1 and I2).
//!
//! A carrier value is only comparable with another, and only acceptable
//! across a process boundary, when both sides can say which computation
//! produced it. The reconnaissance found that no existing identity says
//! so: an `ExecutionSlice` is scope, `LoweringIdentity` excludes provider
//! configuration by design, and four process settings that change values
//! reached no record at all.
//!
//! [`ExecutionIdentity`] is the one answer. It is read off a prepared
//! image, the running process, and the model authority established by
//! whoever opened the container, and it binds the effective MODEL: the
//! same executable realization over different weights is not the same
//! identity. An identity with no model authority, or over an overlaid
//! operand source, is recorded but UNANCHORED, and nothing that needs an
//! exact claim may use it.
//!
//! Every value here is an observed fact of the image or the process,
//! never the environment value that asked for it (the same rule as
//! [`super::provenance`]).
