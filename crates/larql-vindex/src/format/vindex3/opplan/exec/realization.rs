//! **The realization vocabulary** — what a prepared plan resolves, considers,
//! selects and pins for each planned operand, and how it refuses.
//!
//! Rung 3b of the representation/execution contract
//! (`docs/represent/forecasts/rung3-planned-realizations.json`). Before this
//! module the seam between plan and backend was three stored-dtype booleans
//! and a silent fallback: any dtype the policy did not recognise widened to
//! f32 with nothing recorded. Now a backend is handed the planned operation
//! and the REPRESENTATION FACTS the registry declares for the stored dtype,
//! and answers with one [`RealizationId`] chosen from a candidate set it
//! derived from those declarations — or refuses, naming every candidate it
//! considered and why. Nothing here reads a label to decide anything.
//!
//! The forms a realization can take are the executor's own, made explicit:
//! a direct kernel over the stored bytes (declared by the codec), the
//! universal decode to f32 followed by an f32 projection, a decode followed
//! by a lossy re-quantisation (the executor's own compact forms), the packed
//! bank sliced per expert from stored rows, a decoded table gathered per
//! token, or a device backend's own resident form.
