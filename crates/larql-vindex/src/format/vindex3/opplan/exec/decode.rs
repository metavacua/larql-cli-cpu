//! Incremental decode over a plan: operand residency plus a KV cache.
//!
//! A [`DecodeSession`] loads every operand **once** — in the format the
//! backend declares — and then advances one token per [`step`], feeding
//! the backend's [`attention_step`] against a per-layer K/V
//! continuation state ([`KvState`], default [`RowKvState`], or a
//! caller-owned provider via [`with_kv_state`](DecodeSession::with_kv_state)).
//! Each step therefore computes exactly one position through the
//! whole stack instead of re-running the forward over the grown
//! sequence, and every weight keeps a stable address for the session's
//! lifetime, which is what lets a pointer-keyed device buffer cache
//! hold the model resident.
//!
//! **This is the second traversal in the executor, and it is pinned to
//! the first.** [`execute_plan_streaming`](super::execute_plan_streaming)
//! remains the batch traversal (parallel positions, streamed planes,
//! resume); this session realises the same program one position at a
//! time. The two share the operand loaders and call construction
//! ([`AttentionOperands`]), and the decode-vs-batch parity tests assert
//! their outputs agree per backend — a change that moves one without
//! the other is a bug by definition.
//!
//! [`step`]: DecodeSession::step
//! [`attention_step`]: super::backend::PlanBackend::attention_step
