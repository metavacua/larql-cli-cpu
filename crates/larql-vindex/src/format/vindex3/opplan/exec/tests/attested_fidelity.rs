//! Step 5 of ATTESTATION-1: B3 — an attested radius reaching the floor.
//!
//! The decisive regression, with the numbers the contract names:
//!
//! ```text
//! attested parent radius: 0.003
//! shallow codebook:       0.003  → composed 0.006 → rejected
//! deeper codebook:        0.001  → composed 0.004 → selected
//! floor:                  0.005
//! ```
//!
//! Neither half alone decides it: 0.003 is inside the floor and so is
//! each codebook bound. Only the COMPOSITION separates them, which is
//! what makes this a witness for B3 rather than for arithmetic.
