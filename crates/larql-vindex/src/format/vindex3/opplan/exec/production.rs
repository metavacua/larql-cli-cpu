//! The production backend: the same plan, realised by `larql-compute`.
//!
//! Deliberately boring. Every method maps to the most direct existing
//! production kernel that preserves the resolved operation — no fusion,
//! no special-casing, no optimisation. The only claim being made at this
//! rung is that one semantic IR drives two numerical implementations;
//! speed comes later, under two fixed correctness anchors.
//!
//! **It binds the real kernels, not lookalikes.** `matmul_vec` is public
//! precisely so a VINDEX3 backend can call *that* function rather than
//! reimplement a similar loop — binding the real one is the difference
//! between proving kernel binding works and proving two similar loops
//! agree.
//!
//! **It fails closed.** Where `larql-compute` has no kernel for a judged
//! variant, this returns an error naming what is missing. Falling back to
//! the reference's arithmetic would make the two backends agree by
//! sharing code, which is exactly the agreement that proves nothing.
