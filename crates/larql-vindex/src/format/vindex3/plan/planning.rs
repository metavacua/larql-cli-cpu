/// ```
///
/// `Unknown` is deliberately not [`SemanticClass::UnsupportedComponent`].
/// The checkpoint naming a family is not the same as VINDEX3 understanding
/// it: `UnsupportedComponent` claims the semantics are understood and only
/// the implementation is missing, which would promote every unrecognised
/// model to AMBER and destroy the distinction AMBER exists to carry.
/// **Scope: the identity of the model that SERVES TEXT.** The gate asks
/// the artifact carrying the primary text component and no other. A
/// drafter or a perception tower is a separate sub-model reached only
/// through its own capability, and `muse_glimmer_assistant` is the live
/// case: `detect_from_json` leaves it generic *deliberately* (weighted QK
/// norms, no gate, unjudged), a decision recorded in the registry as an
/// absence. Blocking on it here would not have made that decision
/// visible — it would have refused a container over a judgement someone
/// already made.
///
/// KNOWN GAP, stated rather than hidden: an auxiliary component with an
/// unrecognised identity is still served generically. For a drafter the
/// cost is bounded — speculative decoding verifies against the target, so
/// a wrong draft head costs throughput, not output — but the registry has
/// no way today to say "generic ON PURPOSE" as opposed to "not yet
