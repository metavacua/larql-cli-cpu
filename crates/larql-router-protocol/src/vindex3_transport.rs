//! Coordinator-side transport seams for distributed VINDEX3 execution.
//!
//! These are signatures over this crate's wire types: a coordinator
//! (`larql-inference`) drives them, a transport (`larql-router`'s HTTP
//! clients, or an in-process test double) implements them. Living here
//! means a transport can be written against the protocol alone, without
//! depending on the inference engine that consumes it.
//!
//! `larql_inference::vindex3::{distributed, dense_ffn, routed_experts}`
//! re-export each trait at its original path.
