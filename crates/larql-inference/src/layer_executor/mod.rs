//! Per-layer execution surface for KV engines.
//!
//! Specification:
//! [`docs/specs/engine-state-vs-execution.md`](../../docs/specs/engine-state-vs-execution.md).
//!
//! The `LayerExecutor` trait separates **state policy** (the engine's
//! concern: what residuals/K/V/frames to retain, when to evict, what to
//! compress) from **execution strategy** (the executor's concern: how
//! to run one layer's attention + FFN — locally fused, locally
//! per-layer, with remote FFN, with sharded MoE).
//!
//! Engines hold an `&dyn LayerExecutor` and call `run_decode_layer`
//! per layer. The executor decides whether to dispatch through Metal's
//! fused kernel, a per-layer Rust path, or an HTTP round-trip to a
//! remote FFN shard. The engine doesn't know or care.
//!
//! # Phase 1 scope (this module)
//!
//! v0.1 ships the trait + `ExecutorDispatchKind` + one implementation:
//!
//! - [`LocalWalkExecutor`] — per-layer Rust dispatch. Wraps the
//!   `run_attention_with_kv_backend` / `run_attention_block_decode_step_backend`
//!   helpers + a caller-supplied `FfnBackend`. This is the
//!   `MarkovResidualEngine` walk path, generalised to honor the FFN
//!   parameter properly.
//!
//! Deferred to Phase 2 (engine migration):
//!
//! - `LocalFusedExecutor` — wraps `KvDispatch::coarse_prefill` /
//!   `coarse_decode_step`. The fused fast-path doesn't fit a per-layer
//!   trait shape; it'll either live on a sibling trait or be modelled
//!   as a degenerate executor whose `run_*_layer` methods return
//!   `None` and a different code path runs the whole sequence at once.
//! - `RemoteFfnExecutor` — distributed inference (FFN remote).
//! - `MoeShardedExecutor` — MoE experts sharded across remote nodes.
